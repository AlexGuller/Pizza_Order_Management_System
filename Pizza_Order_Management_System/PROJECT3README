BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE STRICTLY ADHERED TO
THE TENURES OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY’S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY WITH
RESPECT TO THIS ASSIGNMENT.

THIS IS THE README FILE FOR PROJECT 3. 

Student Name: Alexander Guller

Total Hours Spent: 10 hours
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenges and Discoveries:

1) One discovery that I found was that I could use the addresses of different 
   variables in my main, pass them through to the functions that contained 
   information I would need for other calls(e.g. size of the pizza into save_info) 
   and then initialize the variable through that function. This is something new 
   and that wouldn't be possible in other languages that I have coded in before.

2) This project was pretty challenging for me in general as well as I've never used 
   pointers before and going from never using pointers to using triple pointers was 
   confusing at times. Drawing pictures was definitely something that helped me visualize 
   how these pointers worked, and heavily assisted in my completion of this project.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GDB Trace: I used gdb to make sure that thispizza would correctly contain all of the 
           ingredients that were input by the user. I tracked the specific ingredient list 
	   item while iterating through it to make sure that the values it would pass through
	   to thispizza were the correct ingredients. I set a break point at the start of 
	   get_thispizza and ran through it using next, tracing the values and matching them
	   to the values I expected to be passed through from the ingredients list.

Commands - 
1) gdb ./project3
2) break get_thispizza
3) run
4) display/s (*thispizza)[0] (display the ingredient string added to thispizza)
   display/s (*thispizza)[1]
5) next (step through function)
6) Input:
	Ingredients: Pepperoni, Cheese, Ham.
	Pizza Size: Small
	# Of Toppings: 2
	Toppings Chosen: 1 3

Trace - 
1) (*thispizza)[0] = "Pepperoni"
2) (*thispizza)[1] = "Ham"
